\section{Proofs and justification}
Some implementation details require further justification and explanations.

\subsection{Ray intersection with a sphere}
\textcolor{red}{TODO:
1. What about b = 0 case? Document (already solved in notes).
2. Put a diagram for defining the quantities.
3. Illustrate the error cases with diagrams.
4. Show orientation of ray has no impact on intersection.}
