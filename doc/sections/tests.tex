\section{Tests and benchmarks}
We document the rationale for tests performed on the components of the
software. We also detail a representative performance report.

\subsection{Tests}
Our rationale for testing is the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Every function must be called at least once.
\item Every eventual error case and condition must be reached at least once.
\item The correctness is assessed on a few samples, through the means of
      either:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Pinning the function under test to a reference function which
        is very clearly expressed with respect to the documentation.
  \item Pinning the function result to an externally computed result.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

As the development proceeds, we add cases arising from fixed bugs in order to
prevent regression.

\subsection{Performance report}

{TODO: * Table with speeds from benchmark for each function.
       * How the benchmark is performed.
       * Why do we benchmark.}
