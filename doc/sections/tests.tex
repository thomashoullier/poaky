\section{Tests and benchmarks}
We document what tests are performed on the components of the software.
We also detail a representative performance report.

\subsection{Tests}
Our rationale for the desired degree to which the program is tested is the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Every function meant to be called by the user must be called at least
      once.
\item Every eventual error case and condition must be reached at least once.
\end{itemize}

As the development and maintenance proceed, we add cases arising from fixed
bugs in order to prevent regression.

At present the test suite includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item User objects instantiators.
\item Intersection functions.
\end{itemize}

\cref{tab:test-method} lists the validation method for each function.

\begin{table} \caption{\label{tab:test-method} Test method for each function.}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |} \hline
Function & Method & Comments \\ \hline
instantiators & Pass & - \\ \hline
\textit{sphere::intersect} & Reference & Validation against CGAL \\
\hline \end{tabular} \end{table}

\textcolor{red}{TODO: * Document test coverage report here.}

\subsection{Performance report}
A performance report helps both the user and developer understand the strengths
and weaknesses of the software computations.
