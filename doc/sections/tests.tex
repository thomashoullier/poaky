\section{Tests and benchmarks}
We document what tests are performed on the components of the software.
We also detail a representative performance report.

\subsection{Tests}
\textcolor{red}{TODO:
* Visualize test cases in jupyter notebooks? For instance, ensure that
  a sphere intersection lands on the sphere visually.}

\subsection{Performance report}
A performance report helps both the user and developer understand the strengths
and weaknesses of the software computations.
